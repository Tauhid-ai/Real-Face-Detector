# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 2 Simple Steps!

### 1. Install Dependencies (Super Easy!)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! No CMake, no Visual C++ Build Tools, no heavy downloads!

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 📝 First Time Setup

1. **Register Users**: Go to "Register Face" and add users with their photos
2. **Mark Attendance**: Go to "Take Attendance" and use the webcam
3. **View Records**: Check "Attendance Records" to see all entries

## ✨ What's Different?

This version uses **OpenCV's built-in face detection** instead of heavy libraries:
- ✅ No dlib installation needed
- ✅ No face_recognition library needed
- ✅ No CMake or C++ build tools needed
- ✅ Lightweight and fast installation
- ✅ Perfect for mini projects!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Make sure your webcam is connected before marking attendance
- Each user can only mark attendance once per day
- Use clear, front-facing photos for best recognition results
- The system requires good lighting for accurate face recognition

## 🐛 Common Issues

**Camera not working?**
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Verify camera permissions in system settings

**Face not recognized?**
- Ensure user is registered with a clear photo
- Check lighting conditions
- Make sure only one face is visible
- Try registering again with better lighting

**Installation errors?**
- Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Try: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` first
- Then: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**That's it! Super simple and ready to use!** 🎉
